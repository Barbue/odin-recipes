    <h2>World's Best Bagels</h2>
    <p><b>Bagels that are boiled before being baked.</b></p>
    <p>Murray's bagels are the best</p>
    <h2><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, divided, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><b>Steps:</b></h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine 1 1/2 cups flour and yeast in a large bowl. Mix water, 3 tablespoons sugar, and salt together; add to dry ingredients. Beat with a mixer for half a minute at low speed, scraping the sides of the bowl clean. Beat at a higher speed for 3 minutes. Then mix in enough flour by hand to make a moderately stiff dough.</li>
        <li>Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cut into 12 portions and shape into smooth balls. Poke a hole in the center with your finger, and gently enlarge the hole while working the bagel into a uniform shape. Cover and let rise for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, start a gallon of water boiling. Add in remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and mix it around a bit. Reduce to simmering.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>When bagels have risen, put 4 or 5 bagels into the water and cook for 7 minutes, turning once. Drain.</li>
        <li>Place drained bagels on a greased baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and eat hot or cold.
